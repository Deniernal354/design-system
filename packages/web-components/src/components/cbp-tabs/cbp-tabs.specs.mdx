# cbp-tabs, cbp-tab, and cbp-tab-panel

## Purpose

Tabs are a common UI pattern of progressive disclosure mimicking the real world paradigm of tabbed folders, each with a label and containing their own set of contents. Tabs allow the user to navigate multiple views without leaving the page.

## Functional Requirements

* The tab set is comprised of a parent cbp-tabs component wrapping two or more cbp-tab components.
* Each tab links to a tab panel, which is represented by a cbp-tab-panel component.
* Only one tab may be active at a time.
* If no tab is explicitly set to selected, the first tab will default to active/selected.
* Only the tab panel corresponding to the active/selected tab will be shown; all other tab panels are hidden.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* Setting a tab to be active by default is achieved by setting `selected` on an individual tab component.
* If no tab is explicitly set to selected, the first tab will default to active/selected.
* For keyboard navigation, the tab group uses the "roving tabindex" paradigm.
  * Only the active/selected tab is reachable by tab/shift+tab.
  * Once focus is on the active tab, using the arrow keys will move the focus to previous or next tabs.
  * Tabs must still be activated by clicking or pressing the `space` or `enter` key while focused.
* Activating any tab control will toggle the `aria-selected` attribute and related styling and emit a custom event in addition to the native button's `click` event.

### Responsiveness

* The cbp-tabs component uses a resize observer to detect if the tabs can fit within their container.
* When all of the tabs cannot fit in the given area, overflow is hidden and left and right arrow controls are placed around them to help navigate/scroll the hidden tabs into view.
* In responsive mode, if a tab other than the first is selected by default, it shall be scrolled into view when the components load.

### Accessibility

* The parent `cbp-tabs` component has a `role="tablist"`.
* Each tab control (button) has a `role="tab"`.
* Each `cbp-tab-panel` component has a `role="tabpanel"`.
* Buttons without accessible label text, such as icon buttons, should use the `aria-label` attribute on the button to specify an accessible label.
* Each tab control (button) has an `aria-controls` attribute referencing the corresponding tab panel's `id`.
* Each tab control has an `aria-selected` attribute, which is automatically set to `false` except for the active tab control.
* The `aria-selected` attribute is updated for all tabs in the tabset when a tab is activated.
* Each content panel corresponding to a tab control has a `role="tabpanel"`.
* Each tab panel has a unique `id` that is referenced by the corresponding tab control's `aria-controls` attribute.
* While the tab set and tab panels are decoupled (not within the same wrapper), allowing for more flexible layouts, tab panels should be adjacent to and next in code order to the tab set so that screen reader users can easily find the content that is activated.
* For keyboard navigation, the tab group uses the "roving tabindex" paradigm. See more under "User Interactions."
* In the responsive view, the next/previous button controls are *not* keyboard accessible because the arrow keys will scroll hidden tabs into view without them; Additionally, the next tab stop should not be in the tab list after selecting a tab.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* The use of `aria-controls` on the tab control pointing to the `id` of the tab panel associates these elements not only for accessibility, but also programmatically.
* A custom event of `tabActivated` is emitted from the tab control (button), which bubbles and may be listened for at a higher level, such as the tabset. The custom event's `details` contain the following keys:
  * `tab`: a DOM reference to the button element activated
  * `name`: the name of the tab, derived from the `name` attribute of the button, or barring that, the innerText of the button element. For tabs with only icons, the button's `name` attribute should always be used.
  * `nativeEvent`: the full native `click` event from the activated button
* This custom event may be leveraged to asynchronously load content when a tab is activated.
* For tabs with only icons, the button's `name` attribute should always be used for the benefit of the custom event emitter.

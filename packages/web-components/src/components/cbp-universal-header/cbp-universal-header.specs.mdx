# cbp-universal-header

## Purpose

The Universal Header component establishes CBP branding, displaying the seal in a standard DHS blue header.

## Functional Requirements

* The Universal Header component displays the CBP seal on a DHS blue background, making up the site header.
* The Universal Header component contains a default slot for application-specific links or content.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* The Universal Header component itself is not interactive, but may contain interactive elements via slotted content.

### Responsiveness

* The Universal Header toggles the seal to a compact version with only "CBP" at smaller screen sizes.
* At the medium or small breakpoints, any list of two or more application-specific links shall collapse to only icons.
  * This is not a direct function of the Universal Header, but rather a design specification.
  * This functionality is achieved by leveraging the `cbp-hide` component in that slotted content.
* The horizontal/inline padding within the Universal Header is responsive and is larger in larger viewport breakpoints.

### Accessibility

* The Universal Header does not render a `<header>` landmark tag or contain a header role since a full page header is usually comprised of the Universal Header in addition to the Application Header.
* It is recommended that your page markup wrap the Universal Header and Application Header in the HTML5 `<header>` tags to identify it as a header landmark in the accessibility tree.
* The accessibility of any content slotted into this component is the responsibility of the application developer.
* The default story content uses the `visuallyHideAt` property of `cbp-hide` to hide the text labels in a screen reader-friendly, accessibile manner at small screen sizes.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* Links placed in a list as the slotted content will automatically be laid out using Flexbox and aligned to the right.
* However, any content may be placed in this area as defined by the application design.

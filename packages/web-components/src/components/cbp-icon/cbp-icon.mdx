# cbp-icon

## Purpose

The Icon component represents a standard API for embedding accessible Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icons into applications/documents.

## Functional Requirements

* The Icon component packages all icons used within the design system that can be referenced by name.
* Icons may also be loaded by specifying an external `src` property pointing to the SVG file.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* Icons themselves are not interactive but may be slotted inside of interactive controls. See accessibility concerns.

### Responsiveness

* SVG files are scalable and work well at all screen sizes.
* Icons are sized by height and the width is set to `auto` based on the `viewbox` of the individual SVG icon.
* The icon's default size is 1em, which means an icon can be placed next to other content and sized accordingly, even when using dynamic font sizing.

### Accessibility

* Specifying alternate text via the `accessibilityText` property renders this text as an `aria-label` on the `svg` element.
* `accessibilityText` is required when an icon is not accompanied by text content in a control (e.g., link or button) unless an accessible label is provided on the control itself (e.g., via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`).
* `accessibilityText` should be specified any time the icon is not purely decorative and this descriptive text is not redundant with a text label.
* Not specifying `accessibilityText` defaults to treating the icon as decorative and the component renders the `svg` tag with `role="presentation"` and `aria-hidden="true"`.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* TODO: implement loading of external icons
* TODO: investigate and implement caching of externally requested icons
* TODO: investigate robustness of sizing options and rotation as a replacement for directional variations (e.g., angle, arrow, caret, chevron, etc.)
  * Should the wrapping component be fixed to a square shape?
  * Does rotating a single instance of a directional icon work or have issues?

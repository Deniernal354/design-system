# cbp-icon

## Purpose

The Icon component represents a standard API for embedding accessible Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) icons into applications/documents.

## Functional Requirements

* The Icon component packages all icons used within the design system that can be referenced by name.
* External icons may be loaded by:
  * Slotting component-based icons or native SVGs inside of the Icon component.
  * Icons may also be loaded by specifying an external `src` property pointing to the SVG file. (TODO)

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* Icons themselves are not interactive but may be slotted inside of interactive controls. See accessibility concerns.

### Responsiveness

* SVG files are scalable and work well at all screen sizes.
* Icons maintain a square form factor regardless of the aspect ratio of the `viewbox`. This leads to predictable spacing in lists, controls, and columns.
* The icon's default size is 1em, which means an icon can be placed next to other content and sized accordingly, even when using dynamic font sizing.
* The icon's size should always be specified in relative units, preferably using design tokens.

### Accessibility

* Specifying alternate text via the `accessibilityText` property renders this text as an `aria-label` on the `svg` element.
* `accessibilityText` is required when an icon is not accompanied by text content in a control (e.g., link or button) unless an accessible label is provided on the control itself (e.g., via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`).
* `accessibilityText` should be specified any time the icon is not purely decorative and this descriptive text is not redundant with a text label.
* Not specifying `accessibilityText` defaults to treating the icon as decorative and the component renders the `svg` tag with `role="presentation"` and `aria-hidden="true"`.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* The Icon component may be used as a wrapper for native SVG or component-based icons slotted within it, providing a consistent square form factor and styling hooks.
* Additional component properties are not passed down to slotted icons at this time, however.
* TODO: implement loading of external icons, including different slotting formats (component, SVG, `img` tag).
* TODO: investigate and implement caching of externally requested icons
* TODO: investigate robustness of sizing options and rotation as a replacement for directional variations (e.g., angle, arrow, caret, chevron, etc.)
  * Should the wrapping component be fixed to a square shape? Yes.
  * Does rotating a single instance of a directional icon work or have issues?

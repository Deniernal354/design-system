# cbp-container

## Purpose

The Container component is a building block component for wrapping content and providing visual treatment such as a background image or color.

## Functional Requirements

* The Container component is a generic building-block component, sufficient for building a "hero image" pattern with content and/or call-to-action within.
* The Container component provides outer and inner wrapping elements, allowing for a background image or color to cover the entire viewport width while displaying the content in the inner wrapper.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* As a simple wrapper, there are no explicit user interactions for the Container component.

### Responsiveness

* Padding my vary at different device sizes by using the `--cbp-responsive-spacing-outer` CSS variable or a similar implementation.

### Accessibility

* As a simple wrapper, there are no explicit accessibility concerns for the Container component.
* The container is not meant to be generic and not replace or replicate landmark tags, but if applicable, an appropriate `role` may be applied to the host tag.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* None at this time.

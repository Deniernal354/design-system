# cbp-expand

## Purpose

The Expand component is a standalone component used for progressive disclosure, organizing content under a relevant heading which is used as a control for revealing and hiding its content.

## Functional Requirements

* The Expand component is made up of a heading, control, and content.
* While the entire heading is not a button, clicking anywhere on it will toggle its content.
* The "caret" icon button will gain focus when using the keyboard for navigation.
* By default the content is hidden, but the Expand component may be specified as `open` via property.
 
## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* The Expand component's content is toggled via its heading.
  * While the entire heading is not a button, clicking anywhere on it will toggle its content.
  * When using keyboard navigation, the actual caret button will gain focus and activation will toggle the content visibility.

### Responsiveness

* The component heading and content will wrap as needed based on the viewport/device.

### Accessibility

* Expand component headings default to `h4` tags, but should use the appropriate heading level for the document structure.
* When the component heading is activated, whether content is expanded or collapsed, focus is sent to the actual button control.
* The button control has the `aria-expanded` attribute applied to convey statefulness of the control.
* The button control also contains the `aria-controls` attribute, referencing the `id` of the content wrapper.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* The Expand component may be used inside of an Accordion Item, but an Accordion should never be placed inside of the Expand component.

# cbp-typography

## Purpose

The Typography component encapsulates predefined styles for different kinds of text that makes up a website, merging design language with CSS and HTML implementations.

## Functional Requirements

* The Typography component contains the basic styles for most forms of text content defined by the design system, including headings, labels, and text.
* The Typography component decouples specific heading styles from their semantic tags, removing the need to choose a tag based on its size or appearance.
* The Typography component can also set a piece of content to act as a divider, either with a faux-underline (bottom-border) or as a shaded block.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* The Typography component itself is not interactive, but may be placed inside of interactive elements when needed.

### Responsiveness

* By default, all text wrapped in the Typography component should wrap and behave as regular text would at any viewport size.

### Accessibility

* While this component allows heading styles to be decoupled from actual heading tags, keep in mind to use actual heading tags where they make sense and use them in the proper order/hierarchy.

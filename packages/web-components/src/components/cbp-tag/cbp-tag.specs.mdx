# cbp-tag

## Purpose

The Tag component is a visual treatment for text, typically representing labels, keywords, or search terms.

## Functional Requirements

* Tags use a default color and have numerous other color variants based on design tokens, including danger, success, and warning.
* Tags are non-interactive elements and may be used within other interactive elements, such as tabs, accordion controls, buttons, and links.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* As non-interactive elements, there are no user interactions.

### Responsiveness

* Tags are responsive to browser zoom and changes to the default font sizing.
* Tags are not meant to wrap and should be kept short so that wrapping does not occur even on small screens.

### Accessibility

* Tags are non-interactive elements and any accessibility concerns are dependent on the content slotted within the component.

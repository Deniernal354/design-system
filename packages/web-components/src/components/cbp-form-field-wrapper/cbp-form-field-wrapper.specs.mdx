# cbp-form-field-wrapper

## Purpose

The Form Field Wrapper component offers means for applying overlays and button controls to inputs in accordance with design requirements.

## Functional Requirements

* The Form Field Wrapper component is meant to be used in the default slot of the `cbp-form-field` component, wrapping the native input.
* The Form Field Wrapper component provides a structured way to add additional overlays and related controls to an input field via named slots:
  * A left-aligned overlay (e.g., "$")
  * A right-aligned overlay (e.g., "kg")
  * Buttons that appear attached to the input (e.g., search or password toggle)
  * Buttons that appear next to the input, but not attached (e.g., increment/decrement on numeric inputs)

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* The Form Field Wrapper component does not provide any native interactions.
* Any user interactions based on the slotted button controls are application-specified.

### Responsiveness

* Form controls such as text input, textarea, and selects are styled at 100% of their container by default, with a max-width of 100% so that they cannot break out of their container.

### Accessibility

* TBD

### Specific Pattern Requirements (implemented by application logic)

* Password/Obfuscated field toggle:
  * The field should include an `input type="password"` with an attached button showing the `eye` icon.
  * Upon activating the button, the icon is toggled to `eye-slash` and the input changed to an appropriate type (usually `type="text"`).
* Numeric Counter field:
  * The field should include an `input type="number"` with an unattached decrement and increment buttons per the story.
  * Clicking either button should increment/decrement by the defined `step` attribute on the input.
    * If no step is defined, default it to 1.
    * If no value is defined, default it to 0.
    * Remember that even for `input type="number"` the input value is a string and must be converted to a number to perform arithmetic on. The `Number()` function works great, as does `parseInt()` for integers.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* TBD

# cbp-form-field-wrapper

## Purpose

The Form Field Wrapper component offers means for applying overlays and button controls to inputs in accordance with design requirements.

## Functional Requirements

* The Form Field Wrapper component is meant to be used in the default slot of the `cbp-form-field` component, wrapping the native input.
* The Form Field Wrapper component provides a structured way to add additional overlays and related controls to an input field via named slots:
  * A left-aligned overlay (e.g., "$")
  * A right-aligned overlay (e.g., "kg")
  * Buttons that appear attached to the input (e.g., search or password toggle)
  * Buttons that appear next to the input, but not attached (e.g., increment/decrement on numeric inputs)

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* The Form Field Wrapper component does not provide any native interactions.
* Any user interactions based on the slotted button controls are application-specified.

### Responsiveness

* Form controls such as text input, textarea, and selects are styled at 100% of their container by default, with a max-width of 100% so that they cannot break out of their container.

### Accessibility

* TBD

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* TBD

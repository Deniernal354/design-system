# cbp-badge

## Purpose

The Badge component is generally used for emphasizing a numeric characteristic of an object (e.g., the number of unread items in a folder).

## Functional Requirements

* Badges use a default color and have only a danger variant.
* Badges are non-interactive elements and may be used within other interactive elements, such as tabs, accordion controls, buttons, and links.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* As non-interactive elements, there are no user interactions.

### Responsiveness

* Badges are responsive to browser zoom and changes to the default font sizing.
* Badges are round and meant to hold small pieces of content, such as 1-2 digit numbers. Long content will overflow and appear visibly broken.

### Accessibility

* Badges are non-interactive elements and any accessibility concerns are dependent on the content slotted within the component.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* For numbers over 100, it is recommended to display "99+" on the badge. This can be achieve through application code and is not built into the component.

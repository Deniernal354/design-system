# cbp-action-bar

## Purpose

The Action bar serves several purposes, the most common use case is a submission bar in a form page. Alternatively the bar can be used to
 contain tools that affect the content of the page the user is on.

## Functional Requirements

* The Action bar is a container with slots for a status or text description of the action bar and a slot for the buttons/links to be displayed
* Action bar comes with 2 variants, inline & floating.
    *inline: is rendered inplace. Primarily for supporting Forms, strucutred list footer, grids, etc 
    *floating: is rendered at bottom of viewport, used for containing tools that affect the content of the whole page the user is viewing

### Responsiveness

* Since content is slotted into the action bar the end user can alter/add items to hide, alter as needed for Responsiveness
* Inline variant is designed to follow the overall responsiveness of the control/container it is in so that behavior does not conflict 
    with these other controls
* Sticky variant utilizes responsive padding variables to adjust as per overall design system breakpoints

### Accessibility

* Action bar as a container does not recieve focus, it also does not inhibit the native Accessibility of any of the slotted content.
    Thus consumers will need to ensure that any slotted content is accessibile (CBP components will come with this natively) 

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* it is not advised to use both inline and floating action bar on the same page to avoid user confusion

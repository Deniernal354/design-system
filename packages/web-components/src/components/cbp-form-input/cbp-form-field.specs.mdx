# cbp-form-field

## Purpose

The Form Field component represents a generic, reusable pattern for form fields of all types.

## Functional Requirements

* The Form Field component enforces the structure of an input pattern, containing:
  * A label
  * Description (or errors)
  * The native form control (input, select, textarea, etc.)
* The Form Field component encapsulates styles for all types of HTML form fields that may be slotted within, including various states such as:
  * readonly
  * disabled
  * error state
* TODO: The Form Field component can handle single fields or groups such as checklists, radio lists, or compound input patterns (e.g., phone, address).

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* When a Form Field is activated by user interaction it emits a custom event that can be listened for.
* All `textarea` tags are resizable vertically up to a maximum of `90vh` (it should never exceed the screen height, which causes usability issues due to double scroll bars).

### Responsiveness

* Form controls such as text input, textarea, and selects are styled at 100% of their container by default, with a max-width of 100% so that they cannot break out of their container.

### Accessibility

* Disabled form controls and buttons are non-interactive and cannot be navigated to using the keyboard and should be used with caution (if at all).
* Placeholder text should rarely, if ever, be used.
  * Especially in forms where the user is expected to enter data, placeholder text with sufficient contrast to the background color may be mistaken as entered input.
  * In high contrast mode, placeholder text is displayed exactly the same as entered text, making this issue more likely.
  * Placeholder text disappears when the user starts typing in the field, creating more cognitive load than necessary.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* This component is essentially required for bringing in the style for all form controls/inputs. It should be flexible enough for various cases such as:
  * when the label is hidden

* Overlays and attached buttons may be better handled by another component, e.g., `cbp-form-input-extras`
  * Right aligned overlays need to still work with inputs that have button controls attached to the right. This might get tricky. 

* Handling of groups of inputs can be done via role=group or a legend tag. The legend tag can accept a disabled attribute, which is an advantage.

* Needs to handle an error state

* When autocomplete/autofill is used to fill the field, the browser adds styling...

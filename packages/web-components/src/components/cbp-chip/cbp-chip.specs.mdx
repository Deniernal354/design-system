# cbp-chip

## Purpose

The Chip component acts like an interactive version of Tags and is typically used for selecting or filtering.

## Functional Requirements

* Chips render a button and toggle its "pressed" state.
* Since Chips are interactive, they may *not* be used within other interactive elements (e.g., buttons or links).
* Chips use a default color for each state (pressed and not pressed) and do not have any variants.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* A chip renders a `button` element and may be toggled with the pointer or keyboard.
* The chip has visible pressed and not pressed states.
* Any behavior based on toggling the state of the chip is application-defined.

### Responsiveness

* Chips are responsive to browser zoom and changes to the default font sizing.
* Chips do not wrap, but rather will hide any overflow and show an ellipsis in the case that they cannot fit the complete label in the given space.

### Accessibility

* Chips render a button that is fully mouse and keyboard accessible with the required visible focus indicator.
* Chips should always contain a visible text label.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* Activating or toggling the chip emits a custom `chipClick` event
* A custom event of `tabActivated` is emitted from the tab control (button), which bubbles and may be listened for at a higher level, such as the tabset. The custom event's `details` contain the following keys:
  * `host`: a DOM reference to the button element activated
  * `name`: the name of the tab, derived from the `name` attribute of the button, or barring that, the innerText of the button element. For tabs with only icons, the button's `name` attribute should always be used.
  * `value`: the value of the chip, derived from the `value` attribute of the button, or barring that, the innerText of the button element.
  * `active`: a Boolean corresponding to the pressed state (pressed = active).
  * `nativeEvent`: the full native `click` event from the activated button

# cbp-app

## Purpose

The App component is a wrapper that packages high level design tokens, styles, and fonts as well as acting as top level control for things like dark mode within the design system/component library.

## Functional Requirements

* The App component contains necessary high-level CSS and fonts to remove the need for HTML tags referencing external dependencies.
* As the highest level container of the application, system-wide functionality may be hoisted to this tag, such as dark mode, performance monitoring, debugging, etc. (TBD)

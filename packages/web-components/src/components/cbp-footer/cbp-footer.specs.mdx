# cbp-footer

## Purpose

The Footer component serves site visitors who arrive at the bottom of a page without finding what they want, typically containing information about the agency and navigation links.

## Functional Requirements

* The Footer component renders the HTML5 landmark `footer` tag.
* The Footer component may optionally contain footer navigation.
* The contents of the footer are supplied by the application (slotted), but should be standard across most applications.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* Primarily a wrapper component, user interactions will be handled by its contents.
* The Footer persists a dark design in both light and dark mode and all components slotted within should specify a `context="dark-always"`, where relevant, to do the same.

### Responsiveness

* Padding varies at different device/viewport sizes by using the `--cbp-responsive-spacing-outer` CSS variable or a similar implementation.
* The contents of the footer and footer navigation should be designed using Flex or Grid components to be responsive at smaller device/viewport sizes.

### Accessibility

* The footer renders the landmark `footer` tag.
* If footer navigation is specified, it should be wrapped in a `nav` tag.
* Footer navigation should also be given a unique accessible label, such as `aria-label="footer navigation"` to differentiate this landmark from the primary navigation.
* Primarily a wrapper component, all other accessibility concerns for are the responsibility of the content slotted within.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* None at this time.

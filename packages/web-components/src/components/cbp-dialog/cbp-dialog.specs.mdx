# cbp-dialog

## Purpose

The Dialog component represents a dialog overlaid on top of the web page, which can be used similar to an alert/confirm dialog or contain a small form.

## Functional Requirements

* The Dialog component will cover the page in the background with a translucent backdrop to put visual focus on the dialog, which is centered in the display on larger screens.
* At small screen sizes, the Dialog shall be positioned near the bottom of the screen.
* Furthermore, the underlying page will not be accessible while the dialog is open.
* The Dialog component defines several color variants as well, based on design tokens (info, success, warning, danger).
* The Dialog may optionally contain a title and/or actions in the form of buttons (or links).

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* A control on the page should be visible to reveal the Dialog. This is typically a Button component and is not part of the dialog component.
* When a button is activated by user interaction it emits a custom event that can be listened for..

### Responsiveness

* Under 600px (37.5rem), the dialog will be positioned near the bottom of the viewport for easier thumb access.
* The dialog has `max-width: 100%` and `max-height: 90vh` so that it will never stretch larger than the viewport.

### Accessibility

* The dialog has `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` applied to it automatically.
* The dialog should have an accessible label specified via the `accessibilityText` property, which applies an aria-label on the `role="dialog"` element.
* When the dialog is opened, or if it is open by default on page load, focus will be sent to the first focusable element within the dialog.
* TODO: When the dialog is open, focus shall be trapped within the dialog and the background page is not accessible.
* TODO: When the dialog is closed, focus shall be sent back to the control used to open it.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

TBD.

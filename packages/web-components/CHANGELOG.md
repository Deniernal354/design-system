# CHANGELOG

This CHANGELOG.md tracks the updates to the web components package of the CBP design system, which is currently in active development/pre-release alpha state. As such, not all changes will be logged; only new components and breaking changes. As a pre-release, there WILL be breaking changes. Upon official release, this log may be wiped clean and started fresh.

The React components are wrappers generated from this package and will share the same changes.
